Setting up my Django environment was a bit challenging at first. Initially, I installed Python incorrectly because I forgot to tick “Add Python to PATH” during installation. This caused a lot of confusion and wasted time, as the command prompt could not recognize Python or Django commands. After realizing this mistake, I reinstalled Python correctly and everything started working smoothly.

The next challenge was setting up Git and linking my project to GitHub. At first, the process of creating branches, committing changes, and pushing to a remote repository was confusing. I also had to configure my Git username and email to avoid errors when committing. However, after carefully following instructions step by step and troubleshooting the issues, I eventually got the hang of it and successfully pushed my project along with the screenshots.

Overall, these challenges taught me the importance of proper environment setup and attention to detail. By facing these issues, I gained confidence in managing Python, Django, and Git workflows, which will help me in future projects.
